# 3D Lindenmayer Systems

I created a 3D turtle for it can draw Lindenmayer systems. I coded a 2D turtle which is under my [L-S repo](https://github.com/Levo/L-S) github repo.

With this project I wanted to clean up my code from the 2D version because the decoder I wrote for the 2D is bad and I messed up a lot of the vocabulary for the L-system.
The decoder in this project is a whole lot cleaner and more generalized so I can have many variables and rules to create these systems. 

I hope to expand this code and create plants with this 3D system.
